HTTPS ?
htf ?

WHEN USER IS NOT AUTHENTICATED
- he gets access to a set of shared demo files
-- i.e he has get access to the gpx controller, with access to a demo set of gpx
- he cannot persist state

-- check for authentication failure @ http fx level (hfx)
	=> handle failure logic in client code

to register
-- via account page (label = login/signup when unauth, account when auth)
-- email address and 2 x password - 24 hour validity
-- signupuser created - NOT A FULL USER => separate tables
-- send email with registration token link
-- click on link => hit server with guid
-- if guid is valid, create full user, and return redirect to app (not auto-login)
(maybe have an intermediate page that stuffs the cookie into the browser - bad sec?)

login
-- via account page
-- persistent auth via cookie (1 week lifetime)
