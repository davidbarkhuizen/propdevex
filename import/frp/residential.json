These options will include high density and more affordable units aimed at the middle class, lower middle class and especially the blue collar worker market to be employed at the power plants and mines.

The intermediate market could also be well serviced by means of town-houses and smaller duplex and simplex units. The development mix will be informed by the market demand perspective to be discussed in greater detail in sub-sequent sections.",
