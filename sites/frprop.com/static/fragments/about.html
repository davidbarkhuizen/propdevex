							<span>A formidable force in the legal field, astute businesswoman and passionate pioneer by nature, Lisa brings a wealth of invaluable expertise on innumerable levels to the table.

							<br/>
							<br/>
							<span>A progeny of Michael Snoyman, Lisa successfully took over his massive practice at a very young age after his untimely death. When it got sold in 2002, the Fisher Roeland legal practice was born - a bespoke firm that specialises in swift and personal service that goes the extra mile.</span>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<span>Lisa Roeland has been the cornerstone of a practice that efficiently takes care of personal and commercial legal matters for more than a decade.

							Jennifer Rose

						<br/>
						<div>
							<span>Jennifer Rose has done it all. Kilimanjaro - got the T-shirt to prove it. Skydiving, hiking, paragliding, caving, mountaineering, trekking, river rafting and abseiling - been there, done that and still loving it.</span><br/><br/>
							<span>This adventurous spirit that has led Jennifer to embark on a life path that is defined by passion, compassion and a pure and simple vision for a better future.</span><br/><br/>
							<span>Jennifer has worked in a myriad of fields, from advertising and sales &amp; marketing, to extreme sports and tailor-made leisure breakaways, continually establishing businesses that break the mould time and time again.</span><br/><br/>
							<span>Her passion, however, has always been people, leading her to pioneer the Africa Alzheimer’s Congress, brought the 2nd World Congress On Healthy Ageing to South Africa in July 2015 and is active in many other philanthropic endeavours.</span><br/><br/>
							<span>Jennifer’s adventures in life and business have equipped her with an invaluable ability to network  and connect people in meaningful ways, establishing her as a leader and innovator in the hospitality and leisure fields. Watch this space for the next adventure.</span><br/><br/>
							<span>Lisa and Jennifer’s friendship has been unbreakable since meeting by chance at the turn of the millennium, whilst swimming with the dolphins off the coast of Mozambique. It is this friendship that has subsequently and perhaps, unknowingly, become the foundation and driving force behind the personable, friendly and passionate nature of Fisher Roeland Properties.</span>
