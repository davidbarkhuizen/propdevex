Fisher Roeland Attorneys is committed to so much more than creating value for the property development industry. The extra mile is never too far.

The company works closely with Town Planners to establish the envisioned outcome based on the Urban Development Framework for the relevant area. Our unique ability to package large tracts of land to appeal to major developers allows us to then match prospective buyers with the property that best suits their needs, budget and brand personality.

Thanks to a proactive approach to packaging and promoting prime property, Fisher Roeland Attorneys is expanding exponentially, with an exciting expansion into other Southern African countries already in the pipeline.

Aside from the existing offices in Sandton and Cape Town, the first international Fisher Roeland Attorneys office will also be established in Europe in 2016, in order to facilitate up close and personal collaborations with foreign investors and developers who are interested in expanding their business into the African market.

Keep watching this space for more.
